Homework 6 - Part 2 

Summary: The main purpose of the program is to create Cat and Dog objects using classes, 
in which the class Cat makes Cat objects and class Dog makes dog objects. The Cat object takes 
in two strings, one for the type and the color of the animal. The program also executes if the 
animal has eaten, if the animal has slept, if the animal is a mammal, and the color of the animal. 
Each of the animal objects have their own functions like a dog has the bark() which prints "Woof woof" 
which is the sound that a dog makes and the cat object has the meow() which prints "Meow meow" which is
sound that a cat makes.  


To compile: 
g++ -Wall test_cat.cpp Cat.cpp Animal.cpp -lm â€“o runCat 


To run: 
./a.exe
